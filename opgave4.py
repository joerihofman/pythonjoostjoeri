L1 = [30, 1, 2, 1, 0];
L2 = [1, 21, 13];

#a
#L3 = L1+L2
#print(L3)
#result: [30, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 21, 13], the two lists are combined.

#b
#l4= 3*L2
#print(l4)
#result: [1, 21, 13, 1, 21, 13, 1, 21, 13] the list is repeated 3 times.

#c
#L1 > L2
#Result: True; the first value of both lists are compared.

#d
#d = [x for x in L2]
#print(d)
 
#e
#[x for x in L1 if x in L1]
#result: [30, 1, 2, 1, 0]; the statement reads the list, puts in the value of each x on place x, if x is in L1
